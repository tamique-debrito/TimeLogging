App specification:
	Main function:
		Recording activities and notes in a low-friction way, in a format that is amenable to later analysis
	Additional functions:
		Recording ideas (should probably just be done with notes, adding an #idea tag)
		Recording things with scalar or discrete values, such as mood or number of times something is done


	Interface:
		Just two main buttons, one for starting/ending an activity and one for adding a note.
		When either an activity is ended or when a note is to be added, there will be a new interface for entering relevant information.

	Information to record:
		Common to both activities and notes will be tag information.
			A tag is a short label added to a record of an activity or note that gives information about what topics the record is relevant to.
			Each record can have multiple tags.
			There will be a tag database that keeps a definition for each tag, so that tags are always used to mean the same thing (important for analysis of the records).

		Activity:
			in addition to tags, will record start and end times, as well as a title and description

		Note:
			records a note-taking time, title and note content
